# West Point CS300 Ada (Fall 2005)

A variety of Ada programs that I wrote for the West Point's CS300 Computer Science Fundamentals course in Fall 2005.

In 2019, I was going through some of my older files, and I discovered several Microsoft Word documents which contained pasted Ada source code as appendices for assignment submissions. Looking at some of the PowerPoints from course lectures, it appears that I wrote this code while SSHed into a UNIX box from my Windows XP Dell laptop. We had an entire lecture covering the proper use of emacs. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

This repo contains my attempt and cleaning up the code from the MS Word documents to get it into a state that can cleanly compile. I happen to still have "Ada 95: Problem Solving and Program Design. Third Edition," which was the book the course used to teach Ada.

I'm really just working on this code for fun. It's neat to see stuff I wrote nearly 14 years ago.

I plan to clean the code to get it to a point where it compiles cleanly, and then perhaps do some clean code style refactoring to make things easier for folks unfamiliar with Ada to grok. Since this is written against the Ada 95 standard, I may also investigate some refactoring to use features from the newer 2005 and 2012 standards.
